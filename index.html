    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE), supervised by Prof. Reinhard Genzel. My research focuses on both observational and theoretical aspects of the Galactic Center, particularly the S-star cluster orbiting around the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*.</p>
    <p>On the observational side, I work with interferometric data from GRAVITY and integral-field spectroscopy data from ERIS at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). I have extensive hands-on experience from more than two months as a visitor at Paranal Observatory in Chile, contributing to our GTO observing programs.</p>
    <p>My main interest lies in the theoretical interpretation of these observations. I study relativistic effects induced by the central massive black hole on the motion of the S-stars, as well as the influence of an unseen extended mass distribution around Sagittarius A* —including faint stars, stellar remnants such as stellar-mass black holes, and potentially dark matter. These studies have important implications for future gravitational wave observations with the LISA mission.</p>
    <p>By using the Galactic Center as a local laboratory, I aim to better understand mass distributions around massive black holes in Milky Way-like galaxies, helping to predict the rate and properties of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) that LISA will detect.</p>
