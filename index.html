  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I was born in Rome in 1998, where I studied Physics for my Bachelor's and later Astronomy and Astrophysics for my Master's degree at <em>La Sapienza</em> University. In 2022, I moved to Germany to begin my PhD.
  </p>
    <p> I am currently a PhD researcher at the <strong>Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE)</strong>, supervised by Prof. Reinhard Genzel. My research sits at the interface between observational and theoretical astrophysics, focusing on the dynamics of the S-star cluster orbiting the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* at the Galactic Center. <p>
    <p>On the observational side, I work with interferometric data from GRAVITY and integral-field spectroscopy data from ERIS at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). I have extensive hands-on experience from more than two months as a visitor at Paranal Observatory in Chile, contributing to our GTO observing programs.</p>
    <p>My main interest lies in the theoretical interpretation of these observations. I study relativistic effects induced by the central massive black hole on the motion of the S-stars, as well as the influence of an unseen extended mass distribution around Sagittarius A* —including faint stars, stellar remnants such as stellar-mass black holes, and potentially dark matter. These studies have important implications for future gravitational wave observations with the LISA mission.</p>
    <p>By using the Galactic Center as a local laboratory, I aim to better understand the mass distribution around massive black holes in Milky Way-like galaxies, helping to predict the rate and properties of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) that LISA will detect.</p>

    <h2>Talks & Outreach</h2>
  <p>
    I am passionate about scientific communication and regularly present my work at major international conferences and workshops. I have participated in numerous meetings across Europe, and was recently invited to give a talk at <strong>NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</strong> for the <em>“10 Years to LISA”</em> conference, in preparation for the future LISA space mission.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am equally committed to outreach. I have given several talks to high school students visiting the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE), introducing them to the research of our group and sharing insights into the astrophysics of the Galactic Center. I also actively engage in events such as the MPE open day, helping make cutting-edge research accessible and engaging to the general public — from kids to the elderly.
