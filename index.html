  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I was born in Rome in 1998, where I studied Physics for my Bachelor's and later Astronomy and Astrophysics for my Master's degree at <em>La Sapienza</em> University. In 2022, I moved to Germany to begin my PhD.
  </p>
    <p> I am currently a PhD researcher at the <strong>Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE)</strong>, supervised by Prof. Reinhard Genzel. My research sits at the interface between observational and theoretical astrophysics, focusing on the dynamics of the S-star cluster orbiting the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* at the Galactic Center. <p>
    <p>On the observational side, I work with interferometric data from GRAVITY and integral-field spectroscopy data from ERIS at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). I have extensive hands-on experience from more than two months as a visitor at Paranal Observatory in Chile, contributing to our GTO observing programs.</p>
    <p>My main interest lies in the theoretical interpretation of these observations. I study relativistic effects induced by the central massive black hole on the motion of the S-stars, as well as the influence of an unseen extended mass distribution around Sagittarius A* —including faint stars, stellar remnants such as stellar-mass black holes, and potentially dark matter. These studies have important implications for future gravitational wave observations with the LISA mission.</p>
    <p>By using the Galactic Center as a local laboratory, I aim to better understand the mass distribution around massive black holes in Milky Way-like galaxies, helping to predict the rate and properties of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) that LISA will detect.</p>

      <p>
        My research focuses on the supermassive black hole at the center of our Galaxy, <strong>Sagittarius A*</strong>, and the surrounding cluster of bright, mostly young stars known as the <strong>S-star cluster</strong>. One of these stars, <strong>S2</strong>, orbits Sgr A* in just 16 years, reaching a pericenter distance of only ~1400 times the Schwarzschild radius — or about 100 astronomical units — at a velocity of nearly 3% the speed of light.
      </p>
      <p>
        S2 has been monitored since 1992 with instruments at the <strong>Very Large Telescope (VLT)</strong> in Chile. These observations allowed a precise measurement of the black hole’s mass (~4.3 million solar masses) and distance to us (8.3 kpc). Since 2016, the <strong>GRAVITY interferometer</strong>, combining the light of the four main telescopes of the observatory, has enabled us to obtain unprecedentedly accurate data, leading to the detection of relativistic effects on S2’s motion: the in-plane Schwarzschild precession of its orbit and the gravitational redshift of its spectral light.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a recent paper I led for the GRAVITY Collaboration, we placed the strongest constraints to date on the extended mass distribution around Sgr A*, limiting it to &lt;~1200 M☉ within the orbit of S2 (central 10 milliparsecs of the Galaxy). This aligns with theoretical predictions for a <strong>dynamically relaxed stellar cusp</strong> composed of faint stars and stellar remnants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of this unseen mass is expected to be made of <strong>stellar-mass black holes</strong>, potential progenitors of <strong>extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs)</strong> that will be detectable by the <strong>LISA</strong> gravitational wave observatory. I recently performed numerical simulations suggesting that scattering by stellar-mass black holes may leave detectable imprints on the orbit of S2 — especially around its next apocenter passage in 2026 — providing direct evidence of these remnants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, the upgrade to <strong>GRAVITY+</strong> (by 2026) and the first light of the <strong>Extremely Large Telescope (ELT)</strong> (in 2029) will revolutionize our observational capabilities. <strong>MICADO</strong>, the ELT’s high-resolution camera, will detect fainter stars in the Galactic center, allowing us to observe the faint, old, main-sequence stars which are part of the stellar cusp and study their density distribution around Sagittarius A*. This will enable detailed studies of the mass distribution around a SMBH that are not possible in more distant galaxies. Comparisons between observations and theoretical models are essential for understanding the distribution of compact objects in the Galactic center and in galactic nuclei in general. These insights are invaluable for future GW observations with LISA, as the rate of EMRIs is theoretically very uncertain and is heavily influenced by the density distribution of compact remnants in the vicinities of the central SMBH.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another exciting prospect is identifying stars in even tighter orbits around Sgr A*, which may enable us to measure its <strong>spin</strong> and <strong>quadrupole moment</strong>, testing the <em>no-hair theorem</em>. However, perturbations from nearby stellar-mass black holes — or even brown dwarfs — may complicate or prevent these measurements, a topic I am currently investigating.

    <h2>Talks & Outreach</h2>
  <p>
    I am passionate about scientific communication and regularly present my work at major international conferences and workshops. I have participated in numerous meetings across Europe, and was recently invited to give a talk at <strong>NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</strong> for the <em>“10 Years to LISA”</em> conference, in preparation for the future LISA space mission.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am equally committed to outreach. I have given several talks to high school students visiting the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE), introducing them to the research of our group and sharing insights into the astrophysics of the Galactic Center. I also actively engage in events such as the MPE open day, helping make cutting-edge research accessible and engaging to the general public — from kids to the elderly.
